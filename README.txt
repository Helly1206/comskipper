Comskipper: v0.80 (Initial Release)

Software is made under GNU PUBLIC LICENSE (see LICENSE.txt)

Please send Comments and Bugreports to hellyrulez@home.nl

This program can skip commercials while still recording. It's a wrapper over the original comskip software. 
Some cleanup is done in the logging output.
Some scripts are added to run a daemon that automatically starts skipping while starting a recording with tvheadend.

This readme is still a little brief, but a extended version is yet to come

Using comskipper:
=================
1) install comskip for linux is explained here:
	http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=150084

   This software is only tested with version 0.93i, but should work with other versions.
   make install is not required, but the software needs to be locally built

2) place source code in a temporary folder (e.g. ~/projects/ComSkipWork/comskipper)

3) cd to this colder

4) configure pointing to original folder (e.g. ./configure ../comskip-0.93i)

5) make

6) sudo make install

That's all

Comskipper has some extra options:
	Signal comskipper that a recording has finished: SIGUSR1
	Signal comskipper to quit: SIGINT
	Command line options:
		-e, --endtime: The end time of the recording in epoch (default=0) 
			0, means that the recording will never finish, 
			a time in the past means no waiting will be done and comskipper will behave equally to comskip
		-f, --frameto: Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for new frame (default=120)

Using tvheadend daemon:
=======================

The daemon is automatically installed when comskipper is installed. 
Is you are not using tvheadend or are not interested in the daemon, change in /etc/default/hts-skipper
SKP_ENABLED=0

The daemon needs some settings. These are stored in /etc/comskip/hts_skipper.xml
server: url of tvheadend, default:"http://localhost"
userpass: username:password
maxattempts: attempts to connect to tvheadend, default=10 (when having timing issues: enter a SKP_DELAY in /etc/default/hts-skipper)
sleepbetweenattempts: time to sleep between connection attempts, default=5 seconds
recordingpath: path where recorded tv is stored
logpath: default=/var/log/hts_skipper.log
comskipperlocation: default=/usr/bin/comskipper
simultaneousskippers: how many comskippers to use simultaneously: default=recommended=1, maximum depends on system performance
updateinterval: to check recordings: default=20 (do not update too often, tvheadend might suffer issues)
logskipperdata: Log the data generated by comskipper: default=True
logskippersettings: Log the settings for by comskipper: default=False
delete_edl: delete EDL file after skipping: default=False
delete_log: delete LOG file after skipping: default=True
delete_logo: delete Logo file after skipping: default=True
delete_txt: delete TXT file after skipping: default=True
storedb: Use database to store current skippings: default=True, recommended and required when using tvheadend post processing
dblocation: default=/etc/comskip

When you would like to post process tvheadend until a recording finished, enter as post processor command (in recording settings):
/etc/comskip/hts_post_proc.py %f
Using this post processor migth be useful to prevent automatic shutdown before the skipper is finished.

That's all for now ....
