HTS-skipper: v1.0.2

Software is made under GNU PUBLIC LICENSE (see LICENSE.txt)

Please send Comments and Bugreports to hellyrulez@home.nl

This program runs as a daemon that automatically starts skipping while starting a recording with tvheadend.

This readme is still a little brief, but a extended version is yet to come

Comskipper v1.0.0 uses the original comskip executable. As the official comskip runs on linux and has live-tv functionality, comskipper is obsolete. However hts-skipper remains having added value and is adapted for comskip. Comskipper is still available on comskipper branch, but is not updated anymore as comskip-0.93x is not updated anymore

Using HTS-skipper:
=================
1) install comskip as executable for windows, or download from: https://github.com/erikkaashoek/Comskip and check installation notes for Linux or Mac

2) place source code in a temporary folder (e.g. ~/projects/ComSkipWork/comskipper)

3) cd to this folder

4) configure
hts-skipper normally runs as daemon on systemd systems (e.g. ubuntu 16.04). If you are using upstart (mostly on older systems like ubuntu 14.04), you need to run: configure --upstart

5) make

6) sudo make install

That's all

Using tvheadend daemon:
=======================

The daemon is automatically installed when HTS-skipper is installed. 
Is you are not using tvheadend or are not interested in the daemon, change in /etc/default/hts-skipper
SKP_ENABLED=0
(However, HTS-skipper doesn't make sense in that case)

The daemon needs some settings. These are stored in /etc/comskip/hts_skipper.xml
server: url of tvheadend, default:"http://localhost"
userpass: username:password
maxattempts: attempts to connect to tvheadend, default=10 (when having timing issues: enter a SKP_DELAY in /etc/default/hts-skipper)
sleepbetweenattempts: time to sleep between connection attempts, default=5 seconds
recordingpath: path where recorded tv is stored
logpath: default=/var/log/hts_skipper.log
comskipperlocation: default=/usr/bin/comskipper
simultaneousskippers: how many comskippers to use simultaneously: default=recommended=1, maximum depends on system performance
updateinterval: to check recordings: default=20 (do not update too often, tvheadend might suffer issues)
logskipperdata: Log the data generated by comskipper: default=False
logskippersettings: Log the settings for by comskipper: default=False
delete_edl: delete EDL file after skipping: default=False
delete_log: delete LOG file after skipping: default=True
delete_logo: delete Logo file after skipping: default=True
delete_txt: delete TXT file after skipping: default=True
storedb: Use database to store current skippings: default=True, recommended and required when using tvheadend post processing
dblocation: default=/etc/comskip

When you would like to post process tvheadend until a recording finished, enter as post processor command (in recording settings):
/etc/comskip/hts_post_proc.py %f
Using this post processor migth be useful to prevent automatic shutdown before the skipper is finished.

That's all for now ....
